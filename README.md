Physics-accurate vertical flight sandbox for testing feedback behavior under limits and noise. Designed to expose stability margins, actuator authority tradeoffs, and transient response through deterministic simulation. Built for rapid experimentation, parameter sweeps, and control intuition—not visuals.
Rocket Vertical Hover Control Simulation (PD-Controlled) 1. Purpose Reusable launch vehicles and planetary landers require precise vertical control under gravity, uncertainty, and actuator limits. This project implements a one-dimensional rocket hover simulation to study how classical feedback control stabilizes vertical motion and how real-world non-idealities affect performance. The focus is on correctness, robustness, and interpretability rather than visual realism. 2. System Scope and Assumptions The vehicle is modeled as a point mass moving in one vertical axis. Mass and gravity are constant, and aerodynamic forces and fuel consumption are intentionally omitted. These assumptions isolate the guidance and control problem while preserving the dominant dynamics relevant to powered ascent and hover. 3. Governing Dynamics The system is governed by Newton’s second law. Vertical motion is determined by the balance between engine thrust and gravitational force: 𝑚 𝑦 ¨ = 𝑇 − 𝑚 𝑔 m y ¨ ​ =T−mg This equation is evaluated at every timestep and defines the physical constraints under which the controller operates. 4. Control Objective The objective is to drive the vehicle from rest to a commanded altitude and maintain that altitude with minimal overshoot and fast convergence. The controller must remain stable in the presence of sensor noise and bounded actuator authority while respecting physical constraints such as ground contact. 5. Control Architecture A proportional–derivative controller with gravity compensation is used: 𝑇 = 𝑚 𝑔 + 𝐾 𝑝 ( 𝑦 𝑐 𝑚 𝑑 − 𝑦 ) − 𝐾 𝑑 𝑦 ˙ T=mg+K p ​ (y cmd ​ −y)−K d ​ y ˙ ​ The proportional term corrects altitude error, while the derivative term damps vertical motion. Gravity compensation ensures thrust commands represent control effort rather than static load balancing. 6. Closed-Loop Dynamics Substituting the control law into the equations of motion yields a second-order linear closed-loop system: 𝑚 𝑦 ¨ + 𝐾 𝑑 𝑦 ˙ + 𝐾 𝑝 𝑦 = 𝐾 𝑝 𝑦 𝑐 𝑚 𝑑 m y ¨ ​ +K d ​ y ˙ ​ +K p ​ y=K p ​ y cmd ​ This structure enables direct analytical reasoning about stability, damping, and transient response, analogous to classical mass–spring–damper systems used in flight control analysis. 7. Gain Selection Strategy Controller gains are selected analytically using critical damping criteria. The damping ratio is defined as: 𝜁 = 𝐾 𝑑 2 𝑚 𝐾 𝑝 ζ= 2 mK p ​ ​ K d ​ ​ Setting 𝜁 = 1 ζ=1 yields the fastest non-oscillatory response. For 𝑚 = 100 m=100 and 𝐾 𝑝 = 50 K p ​ =50, the optimal derivative gain is 𝐾 𝑑 ≈ 141 K d ​ ≈141. Gains are chosen based on system parameters rather than empirical tuning. 8. Non-Idealities and Constraints To reflect operational conditions, velocity measurements are corrupted with Gaussian noise, thrust commands are limited by a maximum actuator capability, and ground contact is enforced to prevent nonphysical states. These constraints expose realistic failure modes and highlight the interaction between control laws and hardware limits. 9. Observed Behavior With critically damped gains, the vehicle ascends smoothly to the commanded altitude and settles without sustained oscillation. Sensor noise introduces small steady-state fluctuations, while thrust saturation demonstrates how limited authority affects transient response. The system remains stable across extended simulation time. 10. Extensions This framework can be extended to include aerodynamic drag, time-varying mass, planar or three-dimensional motion, and more advanced control strategies such as LQR or MPC. State estimation techniques such as Kalman filtering would further improve robustness in noisy environments.
