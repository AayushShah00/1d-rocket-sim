# 1d-rocket-sim
Physics-accurate vertical flight sandbox for testing feedback behavior under limits and noise. Designed to expose stability margins, actuator authority tradeoffs, and transient response through deterministic simulation. Built for rapid experimentation, parameter sweeps, and control intuition—not visuals.
